<strong> Quiz Lite </strong>

By : <strong> Mohammad H Mansour </strong>

My first project working with Gaza Sky Geeks team , it allowed me to practice my knowledge and gain a good experience.

This site is a simple site that allow a user to take a certain quiz and measure how much knowledge does he have about the quiz subject.

<strong> I have divided this website into many sections so I can work on each one separetly, at the end I can merge these sections into a single file that is ready for delivery. These sections as follow : </strong>

1. "HTML" section: This section contains the html code and the general structure of the website.

2. "CSS" section : This section contains the css code that will style the website and the html code from the first section.

3. "JS" section : This section contains the js code that will manipulate the code of the pervious sections and make the website interactive with the user

<strong> The following points summarize the user story: </strong>

As a client 

- As a User, I want to be able to open the app page and see a brief description of the game and how to play.

- As a User, I should be able to check the leaderboard that contains the high score with the name of the players.
- As a User, I should have a button to start the game.
- The game should ask the player to enter his/her name.
- The game should give 10 random MC questions to the user with 4 options to each question(only one right answer).
- As a User, I want to have a button to move to the next question after answering the current question.
- The next question button should only appear/activate after answering the question.
- As a User, I should be able to see how many questions I still have to answer(2/10 meaning that I am on the second question).
- As a User, I should be able to see my score after finishing all of the questions.
